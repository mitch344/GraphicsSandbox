# About
This repository serves as an experimental playground for 3D graphics, with a focus on DirectX with Modern C++. It includes implementations of various features such as Phong shading, a free-look camera, support for loading different model formats, material and texture loading, a timer, keyboard and mouse controls, and VR support through Valve's OpenVR. The project aims to provide a comprehensive foundation for exploring and learning 3D graphics techniques within the DirectX framework.

## Repo Structure

Most of the project's code I have provide is in the "Code" folder. I think the rest is pretty easy to understand.
I have kept a Experimental folder for new features and concepts I'm learning.
